2. For each stock, compare how it does on different kinds of classfiers
    - RandomForest - Done
    - SVM - Done
    - Naive Bayes - Done
    - MultiLayerPerceptronClassifier - Try Keras if you can

2 Months) - Done
4. Show how accuracy varies between news sources (not enough data)
5. Test out ngram-ranges - Done
